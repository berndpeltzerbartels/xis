To demonstrate the use of expressions in `<xis:foreach>` and `<div>` elements, you can refer to the examples in
`ForeachAttributePage.html` and `ForeachTagPage.html`. Here is how you can use expressions in these elements:

### Example 1: Using Expressions in `<xis:foreach>` Tag

In the `ForeachTagPage.html`, you can use expressions within the `array` attribute and other attributes of the
`<xis:foreach>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:xis="https://xis.one/xsd">
<head>
    <title>ForeachTag</title>
</head>
<body>

<xis:foreach var="item" array="${items}">
    <div class="item">${item}</div>
</xis:foreach>

</body>
</html>
```

### Example 2: Using Expressions in `<div>` Element

In the `ForeachAttributePage.html`, you can use expressions within the `xis:foreach` attribute and other attributes of
the `<div>` element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:xis="https://xis.one/xsd">
<head>
    <title>ForeachTag</title>
</head>
<body>

<div xis:foreach="item:${items}">
    <span class="item">${item}</span>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

### More Complex Expressions

You can also use more complex expressions within these attributes. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:xis="https://xis.one/xsd">
<head>
    <title>Complex Expressions</title>
</head>
<body>

<xis:foreach var="item" array="${items.filter(i -> i.startsWith('Item'))}">
    <div class="item">${item.toUpperCase()}</div>
</xis:foreach>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `array` attribute uses a complex expression to filter the items and the text content uses an
expression to convert the item to uppercase.

These examples show how you can use expressions in `xis` attributes and within the text content of HTML elements.

To get the source of "Allowed Operations in Expression Language," you can refer to the `ExpressionParserTest.java` file.
This file should contain tests that demonstrate the allowed operations in the expression language. Here is a brief
summary of the allowed operations:

### Arithmetic Operations

- Addition: `a + b`
- Subtraction: `a - b`
- Multiplication: `a * b`
- Division: `a / b`

### Logical Operations

- AND: `a && b`
- OR: `a || b`
- NOT: `!a`

### Comparison Operations

- Greater than: `a > b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Equal to: `a == b`
- Not equal to: `a != b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

### Ternary Operator

- Ternary: `a ? b : c`

### Object and Array Access

- Object property access: `a.b` or `a['b']`
- Array element access: `a[0]`

For more detailed information, you can look at the `ExpressionParserTest.java` file in your project. This file will
contain the specific tests and examples of how these operations are used.
